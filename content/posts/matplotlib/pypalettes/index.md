title: "PyPalettes: all colors you need"
description: "In matplotlib, when you create a chart, you can somehow becomes quite limited in terms of colors. Libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn have some built-in colormaps (like viridis, inferno etc), but it gives all the charts outside the exact same look. And that's where PyPalettes appears: thousands of pre-made palettes with good color matching and a web app to browse and preview all of them!"
