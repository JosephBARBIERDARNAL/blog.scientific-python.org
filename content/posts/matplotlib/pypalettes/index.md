title: "PyPalettes: all colors you need"
description: "In matplotlib, when you create a chart, you can somehow becomes quite limited in terms of colors. Libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn have some built-in colormaps (like viridis, inferno etc), but it gives all the charts outside the exact same look. And that's where PyPalettes appears: thousands of pre-made palettes with good color matching and a web app to browse and preview all of them!"

## Finding the right color has never been easier

Recently (June 2024), the [pypalettes library](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/pypalettes), a Python tool for working with colormaps, was released. It provides mainly 2 things:

- a [super-easy-to-use library](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/pypalettes) that litteraly requires 1 line of code (in 99.99% cases, 2 otherwise ðŸ™ƒ) to have access to thousands of pre-defined and good looking palettes
- a [web app](https://python-graph-gallery.com/color-palette-finder/) to browse, filter, search and preview all the available palettes (and **bonus**: copy-pastable code to reproduce the charts)
